    A dung beetle is an insect that gathers waste from animals, rolls it into a compact ball, lays eggs in it, and buries it in the soil. This gives the eggs a warm, safe place to hatch and provides a food source for the developing larvae. Which impact does the dung beetle most likely have on its ecosystem?
Options:
A. It helps return nutrients to the soil.
B. It makes animal waste harder to degrade.
C. It causes an unhealthy accumulation of animal waste.
D. It depletes nutrients from the soil to benefit its young.
